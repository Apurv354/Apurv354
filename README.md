I work on developing softwares for robots with ROS and simulating it on Gazebo. I´m based in Bangalore(KA), India.

Since 2018 I've been living and breathing Robotics and creating efficient software stacks integrating AI on them. I've had the chance to immerse myself in many different works and projects, helping to make this world a little better through design & code. ✨😍

### What I'm focusing on 👨‍💻

Currently improving my Coding skills: Python, C++ and Go. I am also focusing to learn more about website development using ReactJS and Django<br />
Learning various Navigation ,Perception and Perception algorithms and use them in practical applications.<br />
I am also fascinated about cloud robotics and trying to learn more on that aspect as well. Devops is evolving day by day and I a m trying my best to keep up the pace.

### What I'm looking forward to learn 🤖✌️

A strong understanding of Keras and Tensorflow API to build various ML Applications. I am also intrested to learn more on the Optimization the maths behind it and solving them using genetic algorithm.
